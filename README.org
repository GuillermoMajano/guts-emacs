* Instalation

It is recommended to download the releases, since when cloning directly from the master branch there may be errors

** Release installation

Just download the latest version of the releases and put everything in your "~ / .emacs.d"

** Branch installation

Just copy and paste this command in your terminal

```sh
   git clone https://gitlab.com/matute_1/griffith-emacs.git  ~/.emacs.d
   ```

* Dependences

** Emacs
You need Emacs installed, preferably version 26 upwards

** Font
You need the Iosevka SS09 font


* Why griffith emacs?

It is only my configuration but wanting to advance it so much and give it support and power I thought it would be a good idea to do it as a kind of low quality Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, I do not know for sure this project will advance, the doors are open to contribute this in honor of one of the most incredible figures in the history of manga
