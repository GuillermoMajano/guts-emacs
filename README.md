# Why griffith emacs?

It is only my configuration but wanting to advance it so much and give it support and power I thought it would be a good idea to do it as a kind of low quality Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, I do not know for sure this project will advance, the doors are open to contribute this in honor of one of the most incredible figures in the history of manga
