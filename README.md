Simple setup for new emacs users

# Dependencies
first you need to have some files that here we will explain how to install

You need to have the Iosevka SS09 font

Directly downloads from here, this varies according to your OS, but I think you already know how to install a font
https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka/releases/download/v7.0.0-preview.4/ttf-iosevka-ss09-7.0.0-preview.4.zip

# Installation

You must first clone or download the repository directly, this varies depending on what is most comfortable for you

"git clone https://gitlab.com/matute_1/griffith-emacs.git"

The next thing is to simply move the files to your /.emacs.d folder
This step varies according to your OS

in Windows it is simply to go to% appdata% and look for the folder .emacs.d

In linux it is to go to your Home folder, there is the .emacs.d, if you don't see it just press Ctrl + H

It should stay like this:

# Why griffith emacs?

It is only my configuration but wanting to advance it so much and give it support and power I thought it would be a good idea to do it as a kind of low quality Spacemacs or Doom Emacs, I do not know for sure this project will advance, the doors are open to contribute this in honor of one of the most incredible figures in the history of manga
